# Mini-Project 3

## Description

The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules.
##
We covered connecting your Express server to a database in Module 9. Now it's time to connect your front end to your server!
##
The goal here is a working full stack application that allows users to sign up/log in, and then interact and work with your application with all of the CRUD operations. (MVP = CRUD)
